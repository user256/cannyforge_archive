# WordPress.org Plugin Audit Skill

A reusable checklist for auditing a WordPress plugin against the
[WordPress.org Plugin Directory Guidelines](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/detailed-plugin-guidelines/)
**before** submitting (or resubmitting) to the wp.org repository. Derived from
real reviewer feedback. Work top to bottom; each section has a *what reviewers
look for*, a *how to find it in the code*, and a *how to fix it*.

> wp.org is **not a marketplace**. It hosts free, fully-functional, GPL-compliant
> plugins. Any audit must assume the reviewer will read the **entire** codebase,
> not just the spots you point them to. Fixing only the flagged lines and
> resubmitting is the fastest way to a rejection — "if more issues of the same
> nature are found, this plugin will not be reviewed again."
>
> **Reviewers list examples, not exhaustive sets.** A finding such as
> "`settings.php:588 __($text, …)`" means *find every occurrence of this class of
> problem across the whole tree* — the cited line is one sample. Grep the entire
> shipping tree for the pattern, fix all hits, and re-run before resubmitting.
> They explicitly note: "the Plugins Team may not share all cases of the same issue."
>
> **For generated/freemium builds, fix the shipping artifact.** If the wp.org
> zip is produced by a build script from a premium source tree, edit the *source*
> and **rebuild** — then re-audit the generated tree and the zip itself. A fix
> that exists only in source the reviewer never sees does not count.

## How to use this skill

1. Identify the plugin tree(s) to audit (the **distributed** tree — the one that
   ships to wp.org — not a premium source tree it's generated from).
2. Run each section's grep/search commands against that tree.
3. For every hit, decide: compliant, needs fix, or needs removal.
4. Re-run after fixing; reviewers re-scan the whole plugin.
5. Produce a findings list with file:line references and a remediation per item.

## 1. 🔴 Trialware & locked features (Guideline 5)

**The rule:** plugins must be **fully functional**. You may not lock, disable,
or limit any built-in feature behind a license key, trial period, time limit,
usage quota, or *any other intended restriction* — even if the locked code is
present "just in case the user upgrades."

A plugin **may** mention that more features exist in a *separate* plugin hosted
elsewhere. It may **not** ship the gated code with a switch holding it shut.

### Ask yourself
- Does any function only work after a license check or payment?
- Is any functionality disabled or limited until it's "unlocked"?
- Are there time-based or usage-based limits?

If yes to any (after excluding genuine external-service features — see §2), it
does not comply.

### How to find it
Search the **shipping** tree for gates and dead-code hides:

```sh
# License / premium gates
grep -rniE "is_premium|is_pro|license|pro_only|premium_only|unlock|upgrade|trial|activate_license" --include=*.php .

# Hard-disabled UI: feature registered but link/branch hidden
grep -rnE "if \(\s*false\s*\)|if\(false\)|return; *// *premium|0 *&& *|/\* *premium" --include=*.php .

# Registered handlers whose UI is suppressed (the classic tell):
# a hook/handler that exists but the menu/button/link to it is behind if(false)
grep -rniE "admin_post_|add_submenu_page|add_menu_page|register_rest_route" --include=*.php .
```

**The classic violation pattern:** a handler like
`admin_post_<plugin>_<feature>` is fully registered, but the UI link that
triggers it is wrapped in `if (false)` — and the feature is *described in the
readme as available*. The reviewer sees: documented feature, working backend,
deliberately hidden trigger = trialware.

### How to fix
- **Remove** all license checks / gating mechanisms that control access to
  built-in code.
- **Either fully enable** the feature (delete the `if (false)`, expose the UI) —
  **or remove the feature entirely** from the shipped plugin (handler, UI,
  assets, *and* its mention in the readme). Don't leave orphaned backend code.
- If it's a genuine premium feature, it lives in a **separate** plugin hosted
  off wp.org — not shipped here behind a flag.
- Reconcile the **readme**: it must not advertise anything the shipped plugin
  can't actually do.

> Note for generated/freemium builds: if the wp.org tree is produced by a build
> script from a premium source tree, the gate-stripping must happen in the
> **build output**. Audit the generated tree, not the source. A leaked
> `if(false)`-hidden handler in the generated lite plugin is a build-script bug.

## 2. 🌐 Serviceware — external services (Guideline 6)

An external service is acceptable **only if all** of these hold:

- The service performs **actual processing on external servers**.
- That functionality **cannot reasonably be done locally** by the plugin.
- The service is **clearly documented in the readme**, including links to its
  **Terms of Use** and **Privacy Policy**.

A "spam checker" that calls an external API to classify spam is fine. A service
that merely **checks a license key to unlock local features is not** — that's
trialware (§1) wearing a service costume.

### How to find it
```sh
# Outbound calls
grep -rniE "wp_remote_(get|post|request)|curl_|file_get_contents\(\s*['\"]https?:" --include=*.php .

# Hardcoded endpoints / domains
grep -rniE "https?://[a-z0-9.-]+" --include=*.php .
```

For each external endpoint, classify:
- **Real processing** (geocoding, email delivery, SMS, spam scoring, AI) → likely OK, must be documented.
- **License/entitlement check** → not OK; remove (see §1).
- **Telemetry/phone-home** → must be opt-in and documented.

### How to fix
- Document every legitimate service in the readme: what it does, what data is
  sent, and **working** Terms + Privacy links.
- Remove any "service" whose only job is gating local features.

## 3. 🔗 readme URLs must resolve (no 404s)

Reviewers **fetch the URLs** declared in your plugin and readme. A Terms/Privacy
(or any declared) URL returning **404** (or any non-200, or a non-public page)
is a rejection item.

> Common pattern: a `Terms/Privacy URL` in `readme.txt` points at a docs page
> that returns **404**. The link must point to a live, public page.

### How to find it
```sh
# Collect every URL in the readme and plugin headers
grep -rnoE "https?://[^ )\"'<>]+" readme.txt README.md *.php 2>/dev/null | sort -u

# Then verify each resolves (200, public):
while read -r url; do
  code=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" -L "$url")
  echo "$code  $url"
done < <(grep -rhoE "https?://[^ )\"'<>]+" readme.txt *.php 2>/dev/null | sort -u)
```

Pay special attention to:
- `Plugin URI` / `Author URI` in the main file header.
- Terms of Use / Privacy Policy links for every external service.
- "Donate link", support, and docs URLs in `readme.txt`.

### How to fix
- Replace dead URLs with live, public ones that actually describe the service.
- If you don't control the linked page, link to one you do (or to the service's
  official, current Terms/Privacy page).
- Remove URLs you can't keep live.

## 4. 📛 Plugin name & slug — distinctiveness + trademarks

This is one of the most common pend reasons and is judged by a human, so treat
it seriously. Reviewers run the display **name** and the **slug** through search
and an AI trademark check.

> Common pattern: a display name / slug that matches a third-party
> project/trademark **and** is too generic (doesn't describe what the plugin
> does) gets flagged. The usual fix is to add an owner-distinctive (often coined
> or brand) term up front, e.g. `<Brand> <Function> <Topic>` /
> `<brand>-<function>-<topic>`.

### The rules
- **Not too generic** — the name should briefly say what the plugin does, *or* be
  an original coined term. Bare descriptors like "Contact Manager" or
  "<Topic> Form" alone are too generic.
- **Distinctive** — must stand out from existing plugins. Adding a letter or a
  generic adjective (*Advanced*, *Simple*, *Easy*, *Pro*) does **not** make it
  distinctive. Lookalike names, similar meanings, and naming *patterns* all count
  as "similar", not just letter-by-letter matches.
- **Respect trademarks / project names** you don't own:
  - Trademark **at the start** of the name implies affiliation → not allowed.
  - Trademark elsewhere without a clear "no affiliation" structure → still risky.
  - **No portmanteaus / blends** of a trademark (e.g. "PricesPress" blends
    "WordPress").
  - Safer pattern: put the trademark **at the end** after "for" or "with", and
    lead with *your own* distinctive/coined term —
    e.g. ✅ `Priconix Sync for WooCommerce`, ✅ `<YourBrand> Prices Updater for WooCommerce`.
    Note "for X" alone is usually **too generic** unless prefixed with a coined term.

### How to self-check
1. Search the proposed name (and parts of it) on Google/DuckDuckGo/an LLM.
2. If similar plugins exist, prepend a coined term / personal brand / unique
   identifier and search again. Repeat until it clearly stands out.
3. Also check trademark usage in: **your wp.org username & display name**, the
   **contributor** usernames/display names, the **plugin/author URLs**, and the
   **icon/banner graphics** — not just the plugin name.

### How to fix (and the slug workflow)
1. Update the display name in **both** `readme.txt` and the **plugin header**.
2. Update the slug / text domain in the code (i18n calls, text domain header).
3. **Reply to the review email explicitly requesting the new slug reservation** —
   changing it in code is *not* enough; the team must reserve it server-side.
   Permalinks **cannot** be changed after approval, so decide carefully now.
4. Re-upload via "Add your plugin". A transient Text-Domain warning before they
   reserve the slug is expected.

> Ownership note: if you built the plugin for a client as a freelancer, the
> **client must own** the wp.org listing (permission isn't enough); they add you
> as a committer. Mismatched owner email/username gets flagged.

## 5. Broader compliance sweep (do this every time)

Reviewers warn that the AI highlights only the *most apparent* issues — you're
expected to read the whole codebase. Cover these common rejection causes too.

### 5a. Sanitization, escaping, nonces & permissions
```sh
grep -rnE "\$_(GET|POST|REQUEST|SERVER|COOKIE)\b" --include=*.php .   # must be sanitized + unslashed
grep -rnE "echo |printf|print " --include=*.php .                     # output must be escaped
grep -rniE "wp_verify_nonce|check_admin_referer|check_ajax_referer|current_user_can" --include=*.php .
```
- All input via `$_GET/$_POST/$_REQUEST` sanitized with the right `sanitize_*`
  **and** `wp_unslash()` before use.
- All output escaped at the point of output with the most restrictive function
  that fits: `esc_url()` (URLs), `esc_attr()` (attributes), `esc_html()` (text),
  `wp_kses()/wp_kses_post()` (intentional HTML). Escape as late as possible.
- Every **state-changing** action (forms, AJAX `wp_ajax_*`, `admin_post_*`, REST
  writes) verifies a **nonce** *and* checks `current_user_can()` when the action
  is role-restricted. When in doubt, check both.

### 5b. REST API `permission_callback`
Every `register_rest_route()` / `wp_register_ability()` **must** declare a
`permission_callback` — omitting it is a hard fail.
```sh
grep -rnA4 "register_rest_route\|wp_register_ability" --include=*.php . | grep -niE "permission_callback|register_rest_route"
```
- Sensitive/data-changing routes → real check, e.g.
  `'permission_callback' => fn() => current_user_can( 'manage_options' )`.
- Genuinely public routes → **`__return_true`** *deliberately* (not omitted), so
  the reviewer can see the public access is intentional.
- A public POST/webhook endpoint (`'permission_callback' => '__return_true'` on a
  write route) gets scrutinized — make sure it's nonce/secret/signature-guarded
  in the callback itself and document why it must be public.

### 5c. Enqueue JS/CSS — no raw `<script>`/`<style>`
Inline `<script>`/`<style>` tags and raw `<link>`s get flagged; use the enqueue
API for performance and compatibility.
```sh
grep -rnE "<script|<style|<link[^>]+stylesheet" --include=*.php . --include=*.html
```
- Static JS → `wp_register_script()` + `wp_enqueue_script()` (on `wp_enqueue_scripts`
  for front-end, `admin_enqueue_scripts` for admin).
- Inline JS → `wp_add_inline_script()`. Inline CSS → `wp_add_inline_style()`.
- Static CSS → `wp_register_style()` + `wp_enqueue_style()`.
- Pass `defer`/`async` via the script-attributes API (WP 6.3+), not hand-written tags.

### 5d. No remotely-loaded static assets
Images, JS, CSS, and fonts must ship **inside** the plugin, not be hot-linked
from your server, a CDN, or Google/jQuery/etc. (This is separate from §2
serviceware — it's about *static files*, not processing APIs.)
```sh
grep -rnE "(src|href)\s*=\s*['\"]https?://" --include=*.js --include=*.css --include=*.php .
grep -rnE "https?://[^ '\"]+\.(js|css|png|jpe?g|gif|svg|woff2?|ttf)" --include=*.* .
```
- Download and bundle the file locally; reference with `plugins_url()`.
- Allowed exceptions: Google-hosted/approved-CDN web fonts (if GPL-compatible),
  genuine service/oEmbed/API calls (document per §2). A hot-linked logo or icon
  image from a third-party CDN is **not** an exception — bundle it.

### 5e. Database access
```sh
grep -rniE "\$wpdb->(query|get_|prepare)" --include=*.php .
```
- Every dynamic query uses `$wpdb->prepare()`. No string-interpolated SQL.

### 5f. Direct file access guard
```sh
grep -rLE "defined\(\s*'ABSPATH'\s*\)|defined\(\s*\"ABSPATH\"" --include=*.php .  # files MISSING the guard
```
- Every PHP file should bail if `ABSPATH` is undefined (`if (!defined('ABSPATH')) exit;`).

### 5g. Prefixing / collision safety
A prefix must be **≥4 chars**, distinct/unique to the plugin (not a common word),
underscore- or dash-separated.
```sh
grep -rnE "^function |^class |define\(|register_post_type\(|add_shortcode\(|add_action\(\s*['\"]wp_ajax_" --include=*.php .
```
- Functions, classes, constants, **globals**, options/transients/post-meta keys,
  hooks, CPT slugs, shortcodes, script handles all carry the prefix. Generic
  names (`class Settings`, `function init`, `update_option('options', …)`) collide.
- Caution: if the plugin was renamed, runtime identifiers — option keys,
  transients, AJAX actions, nonces, REST namespace, CPT slug — may be kept
  **deliberately stable** so existing installs don't lose data. Don't "fix"
  those to match a new class-name prefix without a migration plan.

### 5h. No bundled / obfuscated / external code
- No minified-only JS/CSS without source, no `eval`, no remotely-loaded executable
  code, no compiled binaries without source. GPL-compatible licenses only (the
  four freedoms: run, study/modify, redistribute, distribute modified).

### 5i. Text domain & i18n
- Text domain matches the **wp.org-assigned slug** exactly, and every user-facing
  string is wrapped in a translation function with that domain.
```sh
grep -rnoE "__\(|_e\(|esc_html__\(|esc_attr__\(" --include=*.php . | head
grep -rnE "Text Domain:" --include=*.php .
grep -rnE "__\(\s*\$|_e\(\s*\$|_x\(\s*\$|_ex\(\s*\$|_n\(\s*\$|_nx\(\s*\$|esc_html__\(\s*\$|esc_attr__\(\s*\$|translate\(\s*\$" --include=*.php .
grep -rnE "__\([^,]+,\s*\$|_e\([^,]+,\s*\$|_x\([^,]+,[^,]+,\s*\$|esc_html__\([^,]+,\s*\$|esc_attr__\([^,]+,\s*\$" --include=*.php .
```
- Gettext parsers read source statically. Do **not** use variables, constants,
  function calls, or computed expressions for the translatable text, context,
  or text-domain parameters of gettext wrappers.
- This is not compliant: `__( $text, 'plugin-slug' )` or
  `esc_html__( 'Label', $domain )`, even if a helper guarantees a literal at
  runtime. The parser will not extract those strings.
- If a default string needs a dynamic value, keep the translation string
  literal and inject the dynamic part afterward with `printf()`/`sprintf()`.
- Watch for “identity helper” wrappers like `default_text( string $text )` that
  later call `__( $text, ... )`; reviewers treat these as variable gettext use.
- A common real flag reads like `class-…-settings.php:NNN __($text, 'plugin-slug')`:
  the **text** parameter is a `$variable`, so the parser extracts nothing. Fix by
  inlining each string literal (e.g. an array of literals keyed by field, rather
  than one helper that translates whatever variable it is handed). If the value
  must vary at runtime, gate on a literal: `$cond ? __( 'Literal A', 'slug' ) : 'Literal A'`.
- The same prohibition applies if the parameter is a **define / constant**
  (`__( 'Label', MY_PLUGIN_TD )`), a class constant, or a concatenation — only a
  bare string literal is parseable.

### 5j. User tracking & consent (Guidelines 7 & 9)
- No tracking of users/site data without **explicit opt-in** consent. Analytics,
  telemetry, and phone-home must be off by default and documented.

### 5k. Admin-dashboard hijacking & upgrade nags (Guideline 11)
- Upgrade prompts, admin notices, and alerts must be **limited in scope and used
  with moderation** — no persistent, dashboard-wide, or undismissible nags.
```sh
grep -rniE "admin_notices|add_action\(\s*['\"]admin_notices|upgrade|go pro|premium" --include=*.php .
grep -rniE "remove_action\(\s*['\"]admin_notices['\"]|remove_all_actions\(\s*['\"]admin_notices['\"]|remove_filter\(\s*['\"]admin_notices['\"]" --include=*.php .
```
- Do **not** remove or suppress notices registered by another plugin or theme,
  even if they are noisy or unrelated to your screens. Unhooking third-party
  callbacks is plugin interference and a compatibility red flag.
- Review any `remove_action()` / `remove_filter()` call that targets a callback
  your plugin does not own, especially class names or functions from other
  plugins. The safe default is: your plugin may control only its own notices.
- A real flag reads like `remove_action('admin_notices', array('OtherPlugin_Class',
  'render_notice'))` — unhooking a *named third-party class* is the giveaway. Even
  if that notice is intrusive, suppressing it is "plugin interference and poor admin
  compatibility." Remove the call; if a foreign notice clutters *your* screen, the
  compliant response is to file an issue with that plugin, not to silence it.
- The reverse is fine and expected: removing or de-duplicating notices your own
  plugin registered (callbacks pointing at *your* prefixed classes/functions).

### 5l. readme `Contributors` & ownership
- The `Contributors:` line in `readme.txt` is a case-sensitive, comma-separated
  list of **real wp.org usernames** (not display names, not emails). Add the
  author's wp.org username; a username that doesn't exist gets flagged.
- The submitting account / owner email should match the actual plugin owner
  (see the freelance/ownership note in §4).

## 6. Deliverable: the audit report

Produce a findings list the maintainer can act on:

```
## Plugin Audit — <plugin> <version>  (<date>)

### 🔴 Blocking (will cause rejection)
- [Trialware] <file>:<line> — <what's gated and how>. Fix: <enable | remove + delist from readme>.
- [Name/Trademark] <name>/<slug> — <conflict/generic>. Fix: <new name>; request slug reservation.
- [REST] <file>:<line> — route missing permission_callback. Fix: add callback / __return_true.
- [Remote asset] <file>:<line> — hot-links <url>. Fix: bundle locally.
- [readme URL] <url> — returns <code>. Fix: <replacement>.
- [Undocumented service] <endpoint> — not in readme External services. Fix: document + ToS/Privacy links.

### 🟠 Should fix
- [Enqueue] <file>:<line> — raw <script>/<style>. Fix: wp_enqueue_*/wp_add_inline_*.
- [Escaping] <file>:<line> — unescaped output. Fix: wrap in esc_html().
- [Nonce] <file>:<line> — state-change without nonce/cap check. Fix: verify nonce + current_user_can.
- [Prefix] <file>:<line> — unprefixed <name>. Fix: prefix it.
- [Contributors] readme.txt — missing/invalid wp.org username. Fix: add real username.

### 🟢 Notes / intentional
- <file>:<line> — phpcs:ignore is intentional because <rationale>.
- <identifier> — runtime id kept stable across rename (migration risk); not a prefix bug.
```

For each blocking item, re-verify after the fix and confirm the readme matches
the shipped functionality. Then re-run §§1–5 across the whole tree before
resubmitting — partial fixes get the plugin permanently shelved.
